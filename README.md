## Problem Statement

AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further.

## Business Objective

The goal is to analyze electric vehicle sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key drivers behind sales performance. The company seeks to Understand regional performance, valuate seasonal & promotional impacts and Forecast future sales to plan for expansion.

I have sourced the dataset from "Codebasics Project Challange" which is a unguided real time project.

## Recommendations

- We need to create a basic plan to get into Indain market, here our company will be facing two major issues,
- First thing our company will face the existing competitors and second, india is known for competative pricing.
- We should start with states like kerala, goa, Karnataka, Delhi and Chandigarh which has higher penetration rates. We need to collect district wise sales data for better analysis.
- Initially, We can also start marketing with state level influencers like movie actors or television artists and after some good impression from customers, we can move forward to big celebrity.
- After steping foot into the market, we should plan a simple and more reliable model in a higher production scale so that we can minimize the initial cost of vehicle which will attract business customers.
- I will recommand decoy effect marketing statergy, introducing 3 vehicle with varying battery capacity. Eg: 90km - 130km - 155km with a price range of 80k - 1.20L - 1.35L so people will more likely to choose 130km/1.35L varient.
- So we can arrange for that varient in higher production scale for cost cutting and it will leave some juice for Research and Marketing.
- According to the customer welcoming our brand, we can do extensive analysis and move forward.
